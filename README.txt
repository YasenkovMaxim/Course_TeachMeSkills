My Banking Transfer Program
This is my program that reads transfer data from a file, checks if everything is correct,
and then makes the transfers between accounts. It also creates a report of all completed operations.

What I did
Prepared the files:

BankDataBase.txt — contains current account balances
transfers_input.txt — list of transfers to process

java Main
After running, two new files appeared:

reportFile.txt — a report of all the transfers
BankDataBase.txt — the new updated balances
